    <p>You wake up in a forest, where a black butterfly lands on your shoulder. You admire it while it rests. Another moment passes and the butterfly flys off. You watch it go into the distance. You must follow the butterfly, and you only have three choices of action to make after that. Your goal is to survive this nightmare. </p>
